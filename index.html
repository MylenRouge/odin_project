        Feel free to check what different types of them doing on my website page.-->
    <h1>Hello, this is my website!</h1>
    
    <p>I hope being here <strong>pleases</strong> you as I want to add more <em>visual</em> effects here.</p>

    <h2>Tools and background</h2>
    
    <p>In order to construct <b>my website</b> in life I was using <i>The Odin Project</i> 
        and my previous experience in HTML and CSS - <i>freeCodeCamp.</i></p>

    <p>I am myself a selfthought web-someone. 
        Never had a working experience or either courses behind me.</p>

    <h2>The purpose of the website</h2>
    
    <p>I want to run a pure picture of the website based on my photography background and also 
        bring some knowledge 
        who study HTML and/or CSS in schools or any other quailification programmes. It will include many of the elements here in code, you can check it through 
        <strong>Inspect button in your Google Chrome Browser.</strong></p>
