        <p id="sources">In order to construct <b>my website</b> in life I was using <i>The Odin Project</i> 
            and my previous experience in HTML and CSS - <i>freeCodeCamp.</i></p>

        <p id="background">I am myself a selfthought web-someone. 
            Never had a working experience or either courses behind me.</p>

    <h2 id="the_purpose_of_the_website">The purpose of the website.</h2>
    
        <ul>
            <li>Showroom</li>
            <li>Educational</li>
            <li>Production</li>
            <li>Portfolio</li>
        </ul>

    <p id="purpose">I want to run a pure picture of the website based on my photography background and also 
        bring some knowledge 
        who study HTML and/or CSS in schools or any other quailification programmes. It will include many of the elements here in code, you can check it through 
        <strong>Inspect button in your Google Chrome Browser.</strong></p>

<div class="interpretation">
    <h2 id="interpretation">How exactly this website should be interpreted.</h2>

        <ol id="steps_of_production">
            <li>Background image. Website should be horrizontally placed. 
                Wide of picture should be wider than screen horrizontally.</li>
            <li>Next I would like to know more about how to work with Git and GitHub. Now I`ll start to implement more and 
                more content in HTML and then continue on this work in CSS once it will start later on the course.</li>
            <li>After setting up "divs" let go to the CSS part of this Website into style.css file.</li>
            <li></li>
            <li></li>
            <li></li>
            <li>Modern design made by CSS and possibly BootsTrap in future. 
                Powered by strong JavaSript features.</li>
